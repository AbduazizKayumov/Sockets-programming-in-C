# Sockets-programming-in-C
Awesome server and client development in C language

# How to use?
  1) Compile server.c (in my case, I use gcc compiler, however you might use any C compiler)
  2) Execute the compiled server from terminal
            ./server
  3) Compile client.c
  4) Execute the compiled client from terminal
If above steps was successfully done, then client may be able to write server.

Give some stars!
