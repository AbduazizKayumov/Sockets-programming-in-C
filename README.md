# Sockets-programming-in-C
Awesome server and client development in C language

# How to use?
  1) Compile server.c (in my case, I use gcc compiler, however you might use any C compiler)
  2) Execute the compiled server from terminal
            ./server
  3) Compile client.c
  4) Execute the compiled client from terminal

If above steps was successfully done, then client may be able to write to server.

# Example
  alpha_bank.c is a server side for banking system. To use it, the following steps are required:
  
  1) Compile and execute alpha_bank.c
  2) The IP and port number should be printed on the terminal of executed alpha_bank.c:
  3) Open another terminal
  4) Using telnet service, connect to the IP and port number, for example, type:
      telnet 127.0.0.1 8888
  5) Now you are using a simple ATM, just enjoy!

Give some stars!
